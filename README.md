LIVE DEMO: https://kmitova.github.io/weather-app/

Weather app made with JS, HTML, CSS and Open Weather Map's API. The forecast slider was made using the Swiper library. 
The app shows the current weather at the entered location, as well as a forecast five days ahead, starting from the current day.
Can switch from metric to imperial units.
The app can use local time at the entered location and determine whether to switch to night or day mode based on the time of day in the location by using sunset and sunset times with the google time zone api. Currently, the api key from google is taken down for security reasons.
